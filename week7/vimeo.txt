Vimeo


When entering on to the Vimeo website, you get an idea of what the site is about. The background consists of graphics instead of a plain color which makes it more pleasing to viewers. The navigation bar is present at the top of the screen which makes it easy to find and has sub-categories to help navigate better. 

Vimeo gives an idea about what they do and how it will benefit users and also has video ,aterial to help guide you through using it. They could eventually add more of a social aspect to the site's homescreen to connect more with the people that come on the site. The site also does not have a lot of chaos that would make it visually complicated to look at.
