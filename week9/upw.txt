When entering the site, it jumps right into displaying the products, which is good. A simple color scheme is used to enhance viewing pleasure and add a bit of graphic structure to the site. However, the site falls short when it comes to the product description text. The white coloring used at the bottom of each product is hard to read and makes the eyes strain too much trying to read it. This is not good for the marketing/sale of their products because it deters viewers away from looking.

The navigation bar is convenient, but should have a larger text, along with some of the other text used on the site. The site is pretty easy to navigate and simple enough to not get confused. They also do a fairly good job of connecting socially and using tactics to draw people to their site, such as the hashtag they made for people to tag the site's products on the social site, Instagram. This is a good tactic to draw attention and traffic to the site and company. Also, their products are reasonably prices which is also good marketing.
