Happy Cog:

Happy Cog has a simple design that gathers all their site's information on one single page. This is a nice feature for viewers that want an easy design that is not complicated or cluttered with pages and pages to sort through on a website. This can also be viewed as being too simple, lacking a more sophisticated and complex web page design. The site has a sufficient amount of data and information geared toward helping customers get an idea of what the company does, but from first glances of the site, it is not easily clear as to what the site is about. There should be a more clear description at the top of the page when entering the site.

The graphics on the site are very basic, with minimal colors, pictures, animations, videos etc, but the minimal graphic design works okay for the site. The site is easy to navigate through and has all links working properly. The site simple, but efficient and also has social connectivity to connect to more people and obtain more traffic to the site.
