MSU Homepage:

	Michigan State's homepage consists of pictures, animation, useful links, a search bar and current news related to Michigan State University.The pictures and animation make the page a little more appealing to those who view it. The page also provides links to navigate everywhere you need to go on the website, which is very handy and convenient. The search bar also makes it very quick and easy to get around on the site. The Msu news and event links give you access to what is happening around Michigan State and there are also links to social media sites that also allows you to stay current. 
          
       There is not a lot of unused space on the page and no broken links, which makes the page more seamless, but the page is still sort of boring for a homepage. Other than the social media links to Twitter, Facebook and Youtube, there is not a lot of social connectivity directly on the page. In the future, the page should introduce more eye-popping graphics/animations to the page so that viewers are intrigued when the access the site. The page should also put more social aspects on the homepage so that the viewers feel that they can participate on the site.
