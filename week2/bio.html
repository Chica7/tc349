<h2>Panic website review:</h2>
<p>
 Panic is a company that creates apps for Macs, Iphones and Ipads. Their website has a simple, refreshing and easy approach for online viewers. When you are directed to the homepage, you automatically know what the company does because they write a brief description at the top of the page to see. That makes it very easy for viewers who may not know. Panic’s website uses graphics rather than a lot of words, which makes the easy a breeze to browse. They conveniently use picture symbols (with a description) to correlate to each of their created apps that, when clicked, takes you straight to that app’s page. The app pages tell you exactly what the app is for/does and uses snapshots of the app to show how it works. Their products show to be very useful and also favored by users.

The website is also infused with a good amount of social aspects to connect to their viewers. They carry on a blog where they give updates on their apps, tips on using their apps and show how to navigate through some aspects of the apps. They also have a twitter account that you can keep track of and tech support to help with any issues concerning the programs. Panic apps are not free, but their prices are reasonable. They also makes t-shirt and sweatshirts which they sell. This is a smart tactic to help produce profit for their company as well as advertise their company. The site could possibly use a little more depth, such as an “about us” section where they tell the history of the company and also maybe an “in the news” section to their website that shows sources of where they were ranked and articles talking about their apps. This can help to add credibility to their apps. Overall, Panic has a good site with great visual connectivity that makes it browsing their site very uncomplicated, their consumer market is only for Apple users, but maybe in the future they can create apps compatible with Windows and other platforms to gain a wider range of consumers.
