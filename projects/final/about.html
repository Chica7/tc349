<h1> Company Info</h1>
<p></p>
<h2> Owner's bio</h2>

<p>I'm Cortney and I study Social Media and Information at Michigan State University. I have a background in art and design and also social connectivity. Volunteering as an assistant for her Uncleâ€™s graphic design business, I gained experience in the industry both production wise as well as design wise. I am very creative and business minded, which hopefully in the future, will lead to a successful career in design/social marketing. I read tech blogs and news articles that surround new technologies, apps and software and I also stay current with social sites.</p>

<h2> About the company </h2>
<p>
One day, my uncle needed assistance with something so I reluctantly agreed to help him out. After successfully completing his task, the phone calls I once recieved from him every blue moon, suddenly started to pour in once, twice and three times a day! All of the calls being random requests he needed help accomplishing. After about a week and a half of these continuos daily calls, I finally had to spill it... "Uncle! What is up with you asking me to do all these random requests for you everyday! Am I your new personal sidekick??" We both started laughing, but soon realized the same thing... "Random Requests" &copy; was a catchy title ..and a catchy business!</p>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>
