<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I study Social Media and Information at Michigan State University. I have a background in art and design and also social connectivity. Volunteering as an assistant for her Uncle’s graphic design business, I gained experience in the industry both production wise as well as design wise. I am very creative and business minded, which hopefully in the future, will lead to a successful career in design/social marketing. I read tech blogs and news articles that surround new technologies, apps and software and I also stay current with social sites.</p>
