 I am currently using a pc, so when setting up my development environment, I had to find alternatives to all the mac programs. After surfing the net and google, I ended up finding a text editor called "sublime text 2". It is the equivalent to textmate, but works on a PC. Many people who used mac also said they really liked it as a text editor. I was originally going to use my DreamWeaver program because I am already used to its interface. Unfortunately, it was unistalled on my computer!! I actually began to like the Sublime editor once I got used to using it. I also found a download pack with tons of free plug-ins for it, so it is pretty handy. For my browser, I am using Google Chrome. I love Google Chrome and its the only browser I ever use, so that was a no-brainer! Plus, Google Chrome really is a higher standard internet browser with more capability. 
 
For my terminal emulator, I decided to use "Cygwin". I searched around for a pretty long time trying to find a terminal to use and also had to search even more for an accurate Cygwin download link. I finally downloaded it, but the setup was kind of confusing because there were so many different choices for installation. I actually downloaded the wrong version at first that wasn't for Git, but I finally found some help online and downloaded the right one. That took close to an hour to re-download! I like Cygwin, it is simple to use and didnt give me any problems with the interface. I did, however, have a couple problems here and there with getting my coding to work properly and had problems uploading my work to GitHub.. I had to keep signing in/out and waiting for my work to go through the server successfully. Although I am having a few problem with Cygwin, it is okay for the moment. There is also alot of help with Cygwin online. If I keep having problems with it, I might just change it in the near future.
