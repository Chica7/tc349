 I am currently using a pc, so when setting up my development environment, I had to find alternatives to all the mac programs. After surfing the net and google, I ended up finding a text editor called "sublime text 2". It is the equivalent to textmate, but works on a PC. Many people who used mac also said they really liked it as a text editor. I originally was going to use my DreamWeaver because I was already used to its interface. Unfortunately, it was unistalled on my computer!! I actually like the Sublime editor once I got used to using it. I also found a pack with tons of free plug ins for it, so it is pretty handy. For my browser, I am using Google Chrome. I love Google Chrome and its the only browser I ever use, so that was a no-brainer! Plus, Google Chrome really is a higher standard internet browser with more capability. 

For my terminal emulator, I decided to use "Cygwin". I googled around for a pretty long time trying to find a terminal to use and I had to search for an accurate Cygwin download link. I finally downloaded it, but the setup was kind of confusing because there were so many different choices for installation. I actually downloaded the wrong version that wasn't for Git at first and then found finally found some help online and downloaded the right one. That took close to an hour to re-download! I like Cygwin, it is simple to use and didnt give me any problems with the interface. I did, however, have a couple problems here and there with getting my coding to work and had problems with my work uploading. I had to keep signing out and signing in and waiting for my work to go through the server sucessfully. Although I am having a few problem with Cygwin, it is okay for now and there is also alot of help with Cygwin online. If I keep having problem with it, I might change it in the near future.
