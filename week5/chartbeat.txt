Review of Chartbeat.com

On the chart beat website, color and imagery is used to help create visual appeal when you first visit the site. Although it is not the most exciting graphic construction, it does get the job done. What the site is geared towards is on the homepage and can be seen right when you access the homepage. Even with this brief description however, the site can still seem a little confusing to some viewers.

The site offers a free thirty day trial, which gives a little incentive to trying their service and help to market it for them. The site uses social aspects for browsers to stay connected. It also has navigation at the bottom of the page to help sort through the site, but it is only noticeable if you happen to scroll to the bottom of the page. The site could use a better positioning for the navigation and could also use a more clear description of the site.
