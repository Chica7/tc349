	<p> 
  Currently, there aren't many content categories to sort through when on the site. Due to the site's architecture, most of the content is not organize into tabs. It is all scattered throughout the site with no easy way to search and sort straight to certain content. The sort constructed showed ways to search the content of the site more thoroughly. It put all content into categories accessible on the homepage, instead of it all just being scattered around the site.

    <p> My results from the card sort varied slightly from the other participants. Most of the participants sorted the cards into the same categories, with the exception of a few pieces of content that everyone put in different categories. Everyone was also asked to name each category for the cards they sorted. The category names differed slightly, but had basically the same concept. On the chart, the basic differences between each person's sort are shown.
