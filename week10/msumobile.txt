MSU Mobile site:

	Michigan State's mobile site does a good job of formatting the normal site into a mobile site. The mobile site looks just like the regular computer based site, there aren't things left out just because it is mobile. The animated slide section at the top of the normal site also works on the mobile site which is very nice.
	
	The mobile site fits into the frame very nicely and adjusts size and placement of items very conveniently. The flip down navigation sections also work nicely as it does on the normal site. The mobile site is very neat and visually easy to view and also very easy to navigate through. The type size could be a little bigger, but overall the mobile site is very well put together and functions very nicely as the mobile version of Michigan State's website.
