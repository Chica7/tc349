Etsy is a marketplace for people to sell items they create from jewelry and clothing to home goods. The homepage of the website looks like any normal marketplace and does not specify that it is a marketplace for unique items sellers make and customize. The homepage has navigation to each all the different category of items for sell, which is handy and easy to navigate through. The site is simple, but organized and clean. It operates properly without any broken links or pages.


The purpose of the website is not made easily clear to viewers who are new to the site. The hompage should consist of a description of what the website is for, so the viewers can know as soon as the get on it. It should also advertise more that customized items sellers make are sold on the site, that will make it stand out from other marketplace sites. More interaction should be apart of the site because there is not much social connectivity. Maybe some graphics can be added to make the site more visually appealing. The site could use some work, but is overall okay.
